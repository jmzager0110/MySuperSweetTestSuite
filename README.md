# Welcome to My Super Sweet Test Suite!

I am Jess Z. & I work in Automation of Quality, meaning that in addition to manual testing, I create automation 
frameworks to do the testing for me when it's appropriate. It's super dope!

## This Test Suite Uses a Few Tools to Test My Virtual Resume

- Selenium for E2E Regression Testing
- AxeHTMLReporting for Accessibility Testing
- BackstopJS for Visual Regression Testing
- Buddy for on demand automated testing
- Docker for precision rendering on Buddy

Each implementation has their own README file to explain that tool in more detail as well as how to use it.
